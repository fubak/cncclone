- [x] Barracks unit production system (UI, queueing, robust overlay, and selection logic)

### Phase 0 Status
**Phase 0 is now complete!**

## Phase 1: Game Mechanics (Next Steps)

### Suggested Next Steps
1. **Advanced Combat Mechanics**
   - Add attack animations, more unit types, and advanced abilities
   - Implement basic AI for enemy units
2. **UI Enhancements**
   - Expand minimap functionality
   - Add tooltips, hotkeys, and more detailed overlays
3. **Sound System**
   - Fix missing or unsupported sound files for in-game events
4. **Art & Polish**
   - Replace placeholder models with real assets
   - Add more visual and audio polish

### Known Issues
- SoundManager: NotSupportedError for missing or unsupported sound files (e.g., select.wav)
- Building costs are currently set to 0 for testing
- Some UI overlays and minimap are placeholders
- No advanced AI or campaign scripting yet

### Technical Debt
- Consider implementing a proper state management system
- Consider adding unit tests
- Consider implementing a proper asset management system
- Consider adding proper error handling and logging
