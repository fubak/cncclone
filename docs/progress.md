- [x] Ground plane implementation
- [x] Development server configuration (port 3002/3004)
- [x] Containerized deployment (Docker)

#### Input System
- [x] Camera movement with WASD keys
- [x] Camera rotation with middle mouse button
- [x] Camera rotation with right mouse button (Pointer Lock)
- [x] Camera zoom with mouse wheel
- [x] Unit selection with left click
- [x] Multi-unit selection with shift+click
- [x] Box selection with click and drag
- [x] Unit movement with right click
- [x] Context menu prevention on right click
- [x] Selection sound effects
- [x] Movement sound effects

#### Unit System
- [x] Basic Unit class implementation
- [x] Unit mesh creation
- [x] Unit selection visualization (yellow circle)
- [x] Unit movement system
- [x] Unit position tracking
- [x] Multiple unit management
- [x] Health bars above units (always visible, color-coded)
- [x] Unit type/name display above units
- [x] Basic enemy units (red)
- [x] Unit attack capabilities (right-click enemy to attack)

#### Visual Polish
- [x] Unit movement indicators
- [x] Health bars above units
- [x] Unit type/name display
- [x] Simple attack and death effects

#### Camera Improvements
- [x] Camera bounds implementation
- [x] Smooth camera movement
- [x] Camera rotation with right mouse button (Pointer Lock)
- [x] Camera collision with world boundaries

#### Game Mechanics
- [x] Different unit types (player/enemy)
- [x] Unit attack capabilities
- [x] Win/lose conditions (Victory/Defeat overlay)
- [x] Restart button on game over

#### UI/UX
- [x] Selected unit stats overlay (bottom left)
- [x] Minimap placeholder (bottom right)

#### Resource System (Phase 1)
- [x] Resource nodes (Promethium) appear in clusters of various sizes
- [x] Resource nodes shrink and disappear as they are depleted
- [x] Harvester unit (yellow) can be selected and commanded to harvest from clusters
- [x] Harvester gathers resources over time and displays carried amount in real time
- [x] Global resource counter overlay (top left)
- [x] All UI overlays update in real time

- [x] Building construction system (placement, ghost preview, and finalized placement)
- [x] Building visuals improved (metallic/rough material, proper lighting)
- [x] Building selection and highlight ring
- [x] Barracks unit production system (UI, queueing, robust overlay, and selection logic)

### Phase 0 Status
**Phase 0 is now complete!**

## Phase 1: Game Mechanics (Next Steps)

### Suggested Next Steps
1. **Resource Return Logic**
   - Implement logic for harvesters to return resources to a base/building
   - Update global resource counter to reflect banked resources
2. **Advanced Combat Mechanics**
   - Add attack animations, projectiles, and more unit types
   - Implement basic AI for enemy units
3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Expand minimap functionality
   - Add tooltips, hotkeys, and more detailed overlays
4. **Sound System**
   - Fix missing or unsupported sound files for in-game events

### Known Issues
- SoundManager: NotSupportedError for missing or unsupported sound files (e.g., select.wav)

### Technical Debt
- Consider implementing a proper state management system
- Consider adding unit tests
- Consider implementing a proper asset management system
- Consider adding proper error handling and logging
